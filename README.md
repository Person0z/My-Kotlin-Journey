## My Kotlin Journey
I have decided to learn Kotlin, a language used in Android App Development that will become more important in many companies. Kotlin is built on Java, which will help me understand and switch to Java, which is also used worldwide in many applications.

>  [!NOTE]
> This is my journey of learning Kotlin and then Java. I'm posting this online as the best way to learn is to "teach." I may not be teaching you directly. However, I'm keeping notes that can help you or someone else learn Kotlin and follow behind me. 

## Where I'm learning from?
I'm learning from YouTube and the official Kotlin docs. All YouTube playlists, videos, and other sources, which I'll list below!
